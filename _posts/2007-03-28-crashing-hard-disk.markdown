For future reference when installing a 500Gb Seagate Barracuda (SATA 2!) onto a EPOX 8RDA6+Pro motherboard (SATA 1 only):

 If the computer hangs indefinately while running hard drive auto detection during post, use the jumper on the back of the hard drive to manually keep it to SATA1.

There's 6 hours of my life I won't get back.
