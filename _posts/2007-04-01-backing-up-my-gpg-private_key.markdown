Now that I'm starting to use my GPG key around the place, I'm getting more nervous about the ramifications of losing it. I have some carefully placed digital backups, but I'm still not completely happy.

An ASCII printout of my secret key is 50 lines long, so I've printed a copy out and placed it in a safe place (along with my passport and other official documentation). In the event that my digital backups fail, I can now carefully recreate the key by hand. It wouldn't be fun, but preferable to dealing with the ramifictions of losing it all together.
