This is for my own reference as much as anyone elses.

For years I've used an old copy of [Partition
Magic](http://www.symantec.com/norton/partitionmagic) when I needed to resize
live partitions, usually as a step towards making a computer dual boot Windows
and Linux.

Last week I purchased a new laptop, only to find partition magic failed to even
load. I suspect the 320Gb SATA drive had new geometry that freaked Partition
Magic out with your standard cryptic error message ("error 117").

Not wanting to pay for a tool I use so irregularly, I hunted around for a free
alternative and found one that worked nicely - [Easeus Partition
Master](http://www.partition-tool.com/). The home edition is free for personal
use.
