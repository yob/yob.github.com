For all of my (admittedly short) professional life, my superannuation has been
in [Australian Super's](http://australiansuper.com/) Sustainable Balanced fund.

I was more or less happy with this. Conventional wisdom says that non-profit
industry super funds tend to perform better than commercial funds due to lower
fees, and the sustainable option meant my money wasn't being invested in too
many companies I disagreed with.

However, I recently received a letter from Australian Super informing me of an
upcoming change in their sustainable investment policies. The key paragraph was:

    In the past our investment manager excluded companies that it believed to
    receive a significant proportion of their revenue (at least 5%) from the
    manufacture of sale of alcohol or tobacco, the operation of gaming
    facilities or the manufacture of gambling equipment, uranium extraction or
    the manufacture of weapons or armaments. This automatic exclusion will no
    longer take place.

Hah. Imagine that. Presumably they were sick of missing investment returns from
companies like BHP that are involved in uranium.

Whatever their reasoning, chances are my money is now being invested in places
I'd prefer it not to be, so I've been researching my options.

The obvious alternative is [Australian Ethical
Super](http://www.australianethical.com.au). Their investment policies gels
strongly with my preferences and my non-super investments with them have been
performing well.

Being a commercial fund, a comparison of fees was in order. The results we
surprising and a little disappointing.

[Australian Super's Fees](http://australiansuper.com/formembers_feesandothercharges.aspx):

    $78/year administration costs
    0.77% of account balance
    0% of contributions

[Australian Ethical Fees](http://www.australianethical.com.au/fees-and-costs-individuals):

    $41/year administration costs
    2.15% of account balance, calculated weekly
    4.1% of contributions

For the 08-09 financial year, Australian Ethical fees for my super balance
would've been a little more than *triple* what I actually paid Australian
Super.

All this is ignoring historical returns for each fund, a topic that would
demand an entirely separate blog post. The short of it is that over the
previous 5 years, Australian Ethical seems to have performed worse on
comparable funds.

So do I move? Are there other ethical super options out there? What premium am
I willing to cop in return for having my money invested in ethical companies?
