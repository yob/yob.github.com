Several years ago [Xavier Shay](http://rhnh.net/) published his [db2s3](http://rubygems.org/gems/db2s3)
gem for backing up the database from your rails project to Amazon S3.

Xavier's original code depended on the
[aws-s3](http://rubygems.org/gems/aws-s3) gem. aws-s3 works well enough,
however it appears to be unmaintained and has a few rough edges. In particular,
it doesn't cleanly handle S3 regions outside US-east. It also uses class
variables for configuration, making it difficult to authenticate with alternate
accounts at other points in my application.

The solution to these issues was to switch the dependency from aws-s3 to
[fog](http://rubygems.org/gems/fog), a newer gem that is actively maintained.
As a bonus, it also brings us support for additional storage providers like
[Rackspace cloudfiles](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/) and
[Ninefold](http://ninefold.com/).

After [checking with Xavier](https://twitter.com/#!/jim_healy/status/93910235277836288)
I've forked his code and released a new gem - [db2fog](http://rubygems.org/gems/db2fog).

To use it, start by adding it to the Gemfile in your rails app:

{% highlight bash%}
    gem 'db2fog'
{% endhighlight %}

Then configure it by putting this in config/initializers/db2fog.rb:

{% highlight ruby %}
    DB2Fog.config = {
      :aws_access_key_id     => 'yourkey',
      :aws_secret_access_key => 'yoursecretkey',
      :directory             => 'bucket-name',
      :provider              => 'AWS'
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Now use the rake tasks to perform backups and restores. Run them manually
first, then add them to cron for automatic backups. I recommend running 
a few backup every few hours and the clean task daily.

{% highlight bash %}
    rake db2fog:backup:full  RAILS_ENV=production
    rake db2fog:backup:clean RAILS_ENV=production
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! A dead simple way to get offsite backups that will probably cost you
only cents per month. For details and examples for configuring sotrage
providers like Rackspace check the [project
README](https://github.com/yob/db2fog) on github.
