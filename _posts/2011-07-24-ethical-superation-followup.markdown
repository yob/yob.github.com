Some time ago I got angry with my faux-ethical superannuation and [did some
research on alternatives](/2010/01/16/ethical-superannuation.html). Then I put
off making a decision for 18 months. I excel at delaying hard decisions,
and comparing Super funds is definitely hard.

This week I finally decided I needed to do something about it. I'm pessimistic
about the short term prospects for global markets anyway, so I've decided to
simultaneously lower my risk profile and move my superannuation to [Australian
Ethical](http://www.austethical.com.au/).

Super company documentation makes comparing returns almost impossible, but I'm
confident I'll get returns I'm happy with whilst avoiding companies making
money in unethical and unsustainable ways.
