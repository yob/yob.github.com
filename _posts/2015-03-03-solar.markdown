title: Monitoring Solar Panel Output
---

We recently installed 3kW of solar panels on our house, and being a data nerd I
was keen to monitor their performance.

Our system is a [Fronius Galvo 3.0-1](http://www.fronius.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-94B2C3E7-6041D541/fronius_international/hs.xsl/83_28031_ENG_HTML.htm#.VPUjXnREHWU)
inverter paired with 12x [260W REC panels](http://www.recgroup.com/products/recpeakenergyseries/).

From a monitoring perspective, the Galvo 3.0-1 seems to have been a good choice.
It comes with wifi, and the installer connected it to our network on
installation day. From there, I was able to connect to a web interface and poke
around.

I clicked a button to upgrade the firmware to 3.3.5-22, which included a new
"Push Service" feature. This pings a remote HTTP or FTP server at regular
intervals with the latest output data.

Following instructions from
[pvoutput](http://pvoutput.org/help.html#push-froniuspost), I configured the
inverter to update my [pvoutput.org
profile](http://pvoutput.org/list.jsp?sid=34692) every 5 minutes, leading to
charts like this:

pvoutput.org has a public API, so there's also a few android/iOS apps
available. None are perfect, but my current favourite is [Oxley
Solar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.oxleyws.solar&hl=en).
Its intra-day charts look like this:

There's also a [well documented](http://www.fronius.com/cps/rde/xbcr/SID-ACEDAD0F-36E36A58/fronius_international/42_0410_2012_318486_snapshot.pdf)
HTTP JSON API available on the inverter. I'm not actively using it, but it's
straight forward:

    curl "http://10.1.1.2/solar_api/v1/GetInverterRealtimeData.cgi?Scope=Device&DeviceID=1&DataCollection=CommonInverterData"
    {
            "Head" : {
                    "RequestArguments" : {
                            "DataCollection" : "CommonInverterData",
                            "DeviceClass" : "Inverter",
                            "DeviceId" : "1",
                            "Scope" : "Device"
                    },
                    "Status" : {
                            "Code" : 0,
                            "Reason" : "",
                            "UserMessage" : ""
                    },
                    "Timestamp" : "2015-03-03T15:30:00+11:00"
            },
            "Body" : {...}
    }
