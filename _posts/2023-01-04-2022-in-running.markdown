title: "2022 in Running"
---
In [2020](https://yob.id.au/2021/01/01/2020-in-running.html) and
[2021](https://yob.id.au/2022/01/01/2021-in-running.html) I found it useful to
reflect on my running and set new goals, time for 2022.

My 2022 goals:

> get out 156 times - 3 times/week - and cover 1200Km (100Km/month). Both are
> only incremental improvements on 2021 and that‚Äôs OK. Locking in the habit of
> regular outings is the top goal (presumably around a busier calendar with
> fewer lockdowns), distance and speed are secondary. Still, a sub 2 hour half
> marathon would be a nice bonus if I can manage it, as would shaving some
> seconds off my 5km and 10km PBs.

I managed to hit my main goals - 183 runs in total (3.5/week), and 1596 Kms
(133/month).

I also ran my first marathon ([Melbourne,
04:35:44](https://www.strava.com/activities/7897119249)), two half marathons
([1](https://www.strava.com/activities/7030597469),
[2](https://www.strava.com/activities/7442999652), both sub 2 hours), and a
handful of solo long runs over 21Km. A solo highlight was [31Km from Stawell to
Halls Gap](https://www.strava.com/activities/8304569126) right at the end of
the year.

With my top goal being regular outings and habit building, I like that my
cumulative distance chart is relatively linear. Two spots of COVID and some
minor overuse injuries are visible in the occasional plateau too.

New PBs:
* 5Km [~22:00](https://www.strava.com/activities/6987990305)
* 10Km [48:57](https://www.strava.com/activities/7633761969)
* Half Marathon [1:54:09](https://www.strava.com/activities/7442999652)
* Marathon [4:35:44](https://www.strava.com/activities/7897119249)

Parkrun continues to be a useful part of the routine. I walked or ran 25 over the
year, volunteered a few times, and passed the 50 walk/runs milestone on
Christmas Day üéÅ. [Merri Creek Running Club](https://merricreekrunning.club/)
provided excelent motivation to get up early once a week, and the [Coburg
Harriers](https://www.coburgharriers.org.au/) middle distance group added some
friendly variety to my training schedule.

No significant change in my gear this year, still using the [Garmin forerunner
245 music](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/p/646690), my phone for music and
podcasts, a [flip belt](https://flipbeltaustralia.com/product/flipbelt/), and
various Vivo Barefoot shoes. I did manage to drop a headphone down a drain, and
I replaced them with a pair of [Jabra Elite 4
Active's](https://www.jabra.com.au/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active).

2023 goals: Cover 2023Km (168Km/month). This feels ambitious and I'm not sure
I'll hit it. It's an increase of ~26% on 2022 and I'm confident I could do it
physically, but it's about 38 Kms and 4 hours/week. Fitting that in around work
and family logistics every week of the year might be a challenge. We'll see.
