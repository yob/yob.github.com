title: "2024 in Running"
---

Unlike [earlier](https://yob.id.au/2022/01/01/2021-in-running.html)
[years](https://yob.id.au/2023/01/04/2022-in-running.html), I had no
considered running goals for 2024. I went in with a half baked plan to hit
2024km for for the calendar year, maybe via 3+ outings/week averaging
~40km/week. Like previous years, I valued consistency and habit building over
distance or time PBs.

Sadly, it played out very differently. My cumulative distance chart flattens out
several times, all due to injury - each seemingly unrelated, but maybe they
tell a story of overuse or lacking strength.

The three main plateaus are a left calf (soleus) strain, a lower back injury
(from poor form at the gym during strength work, no less), and a mystery left
hip strain that's probably [Iliopsoas Tendinopathy or Bursitis](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Iliopsoas_Tendinopathy).
There were also some niggly right achilles issues early in the year that I ran
through.

The result was also my first drop in yearly aggregate distance in 8 years:

Despite all that I hit a couple of new PBs in the injury free parts of the year

* 1Km [~3:40](https://www.strava.com/activities/10765026655)
* 10Km [48:16](https://www.strava.com/activities/11024297235)

Parkrun's gamification continues to help get me out the door and stretching the legs. I walked or ran 37 over the
year, volunteered a few times, and passed the 100 walk/runs milestone. [Merri
Creek Running Club](https://merricreekrunning.club/) provided excellent
motivation to get up early once a week, and the [Coburg
Harriers](https://www.coburgharriers.org.au/) middle distance group added some
friendly intervals to my training schedule. Shout out to the folks at [reload
physio](https://reload.physio/) for supporting me through a injury prone year
too.

On the gear front, I upgraded to a [Garmin forerunner
265](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/p/886785). It's fine. It has a fancy colour
screen that needs to turn itself off to save battery - if I had my time again,
I might go the 255 to get most of the 265 features but with an old
fashioned always on MIP black and white screen. I still use my phone for music
and podcasts, [Jabra Elite 4 Active's](https://www.jabra.com.au/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active), a
[flip belt](https://flipbeltaustralia.com/product/flipbelt/), and various Vivo
Barefoot shoes. I have started to dabble in alternative shoes to see what I
think - a pair of [Altra Lone Peak
7s](https://leave-the-road-and.run/altra-lone-peak-7-review-after-600km/). The
jury is still out, but I don't hate 'em. 

2025 goals: if I can get on top of these injuries, cover 2025Km (169km/month,
38.9km/week). This feels ambitious and I'm not sure I'll hit it, particularly
as the weeks tick over with this hip issue and I'll need to rebuild my weekly
distance slowly. Let's See. I've optimistically signed up for Melbourne
marathon in October as well ðŸ˜¬
