title: "2025 in Running"
---

[2024 was the first year my annual running volume dropped](/2025/01/17/2024-in-running.html)
since I started to regularly run, and I backed that up with a 2025 that was even
lower - 930km:

[At the start of 2025 I said](/2025/01/17/2024-in-running.html):

> 2025 goals: if I can get on top of these injuries, cover 2025Km (169km/month,
> 38.9km/week). This feels ambitious and I'm not sure I'll hit it, particularly

At the time I wrote that my physio suspected my left hip issue was [Iliopsoas Tendinopathy or Bursitis](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Iliopsoas_Tendinopathy).
However, by late January an MRI led to a [Bone Stress Injury (BSI)](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bone_Stress_Injuries) diagnosis
for my left medial femur neck. The physio was clear: stop running and let it
heal or risk a fracture and surgery. He described it as a low grade injury in
a high risk area.

Consequently, Feb-Apr was a lot of walking then re-building (1 min walk, 1 min
run...). I lost fitness, and then (of course) nursed a mild left calf strain
on and off May-Aug as I tried to return from the hip. The good news is Oct-Dec
went well and I finished the year in good form, consistently manging 30km
weeks across 3-4 runs and no niggles.

No PBs this year of course. I had a Melbourne Marathon entry (purchased pre-injury)
and stubbornly had a crack despite not having completed a proper training block.
[I finished in 05:04:14](https://www.strava.com/activities/16111611157/overview) -
the first ~28km went well, the rest we won't speak of again. I've learnt my lesson
about marathon preparedness.

I had a great year of Parkrun, running (or walking, or walk-running) 45 times
and volunteering 21 times. Many of the volunteer shifts were with one or both of
the kids, which was a highlight. The [Merri Creek Running Club](https://merricreekrunning.club/)
continued to be an enjoyable weekly routine, even if some of them involved meeting
the group but then setting off on a solo walk.

No major changes to gear this year. My go to's include a [Garmin forerunner 265](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/p/886785),
[Jabra Elite 4 Active's](https://www.jabra.com.au/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active), a
[flip belt](https://flipbeltaustralia.com/product/flipbelt/), a phone for music/podcasts/audio books,
and various Vivo Barefoot shoes. In 2024 I dabbled in a pair of zero-drop
Altra's to see if they reduced injuries and they didn't, so for 2025 I went back to all
Vivo's.

2026 goals: 2024-25 were so injury prone it was discouraging. I'm going back in time
and back to basics. What matters to my physical and mental health is the routine and
regular exercise, so I'll take inspiration from my [2022 goals](/2022/01/01/2021-in-running.html).
I'll aim to get out 156 times - 3 times/week - and cover 1200Km (100Km/month). I'll also aim for
at least one 21Km+ activity per month, even if some are training runs that include some walking.

<sub>However, I did panic enter the Melbourne Marathon ballot out of FOMO and got in. Let's
see how I feel in September.</sub>
