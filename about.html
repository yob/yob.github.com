<h2>Work</h2>

<p>I earn a crust as a freelance web developer. I have a strong preference for
Ruby based solutions, but have been known to work in PHP when asked. I'm based
in Melbourne, Australia and will travel or work remotely when necessary.</p>

<p>I have particular experience in supply chain solutions, the PDF specification,
the book/publishing industry and character encodings.</p>

<p>Open sourced code make me happy. If I'm working for you I'll probably use a range
of open source tools, and I'll encourage you to give back and release some of
your code in the same way. Most open source code that I release is available 
on <a href="http://github.com/yob">github</a>.</p>

<p>I believe strongly in automated testing of my code and version control. I've
also recently started to explore the value of code metrics to improve code
quality.  My version control system of choice is <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>
however I speak fluent <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> as well.</p>

<p>In a past life I was a <a href="http://caia.swin.edu.au/cv/jhealy/">research assistant</a>
at the Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures at Swinburne Uni.</p>

<h2>This Site</h2>

<p>This site is statically compiled using the super flexible and powerful
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. There's a lot to be said about staying
static where appropriate.</p>

<p>One downside is it makes comments difficult. It's a trade off I'm currently
prepared to live with, comments via email are welcomed.</p>
