I'm a fan of the new [gem dependency](http://railscasts.com/episodes/110)
feature added to Rails 2.1 and have started using it where possible.

Locking the app to a particular version is the right thing to do - loading the
most recent version is just asking for trouble. What happens when your
development and production boxes have different gem versions, or when the gem
maintainer introduces an API incompatible change?

I have a few apps in production though, and often forget what gem versions
I've locked the app to, and therefore don't realise when it's loading an out of
date version. An out of date gem isn't a huge issue, but there might be new 
features that are useful, or fixed bugs that I hadn't noticed.

I've put together a [little initializer](/files/check_gem_versions.rb) that checks all
the gems I've loaded when the rails app starts, and logs a notice to let me
know if it's out of date. It's non fatal - sometimes there are gems where I
want to be using an old version, but it's nice to be reminded that it might be
worth upgrading.
