## Code

By day (and occasionally at night) I'm a programmer with a penchant for Ruby. Here's a few of the projects I've released:

* [RBook](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbook) - A set of ruby libraries for working with bibliographic data
* [PDF::Reader](http://rubyforge.org/projects/pdf-reader) - A pure ruby library for extracting data and stats on PDF files
* [PDF::Wrapper](http://rubyforge.org/projects/pdf-wrapper) - A Unicode aware ruby library for generating PDF files
* [Misc Rubygems](http://rubyforge.org/projects/yob-projects/) - A dumping ground for small gems that don't deserve their own project

And projects led by others that I've been involved with or contributed to:

* [Ruport](http://www.rubyreports.com/) - A ruby library for generating reports
* [Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/) - A pure ruby PDF generation library
* [Thinking Sphinx](http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/) - A rails and merb plugin that makes searching with the sphinx engine a breeze.

Most of the open source code I work on is available at my github account: [http://github.com/yob](http://github.com/yob).
