## Code

By day (and occasionally at night) I'm a programmer with a penchant for Ruby. Here's a few of the projects I'm involved in (or have been involved in).

* [RBook](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbook) - A ruby library for working with bibliographic data
* [Ruport](http://ruport.infogami.com/) - A ruby library for generating reports
