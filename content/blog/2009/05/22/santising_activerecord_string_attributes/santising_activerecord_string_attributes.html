Some time ago I realised that for the vast majority of string attributes on my
ActiveRecord models, I want a blank string submitted by the user to be saved
to the database as NULL. In addition, it would be nice to remove trailing white
space. [Others](http://marklunds.com/articles/one/398) seem to
[agree](http://www.webdevbros.net/2008/01/22/automatically-strip-attributes-of-an-activerecord-model/#more-148).

I started writing a small Rails plugin to achieve my goal via a
before_validation callback, but then found an existing
plugin, [StripAttributes](http://github.com/rmm5t/strip_attributes) that did the job just fine.

More recently I found some additional sanitation I needed to perform on the
string attributes in a project.

In the first case, I was processing a large volume of CSV data and creating new
AR records. It turned out the data had some odd [ASCII control
characters](http://asciitable.com/) in it (like 0x0B - vertical tab) that were
causing grief elsewhere in the app.

In this day and age it's rare to require the use of ASCII control characters,
so I built a new plugin to strip them out before a model is saved. The plugin
is essentially a fork of StripAttributes so I won't claim it's innovative, but
it's useful.

[StripControlChars](http://github.com/yob/strip_control_chars) can be found on
github and installed as a gem.

    gem install strip_control_chars

Load the gem from your environment.rb file:

    config.gem 'strip_control_chars'

And add the macro to the models you want to use it with:

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      strip_control_chars!
    end

    p = Product.create!(:name => "Some\x0BWidget")
    puts p.name
    => Some Widget

The following bytes will be replaced with a standard space (0x20): 0x00, 0x01,
0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0E, 0x0F, 0x10, 0x11,
0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1A, 0x1B, 0x1C, 0x1D, 0x1E,
0x1F

Whilst I was making plugins based on StripAttributes, I made another that
replaces various "smart quotes" with their ASCII equivalents. It's somewhat
less useful than StripControlChars and will probably get me in trouble with
typographers, but them's the breaks. It operates in the same way as
StripControlChars, so doesn't really deserve its own blog post. Check it out on
