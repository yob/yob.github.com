## Perforce

Perforce is a proprietary version control system used by FreeBSD (amongst
others). It's a little archaic, so here's a few common steps I use.

A great source of further info is (Perforce in FreeBSD Development)[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/p4-primer/article.html]

### Integrate

Integrating it pulling changes from the original branch your branch came from
to keep them in sync.

    p4 integrate -b <branch_name>

After integrating, you'll want to resolve any conflicts, then submit the changes

    p4 resolve -as
    p4 submit

### Diffs

To diff a branch against the branch it forked from:

    p4 diff2 -u -b <branch_name>

You'll want to do an integration before doing this, to ensure the diff contains only the changes in your branch.
