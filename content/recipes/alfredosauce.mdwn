h3. Ingrediants
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 2 cup heavy (whipping) cream
* ¼ cup parmesan cheese, grated
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* salt

h3. Method

Melt the butter over medium-high heat, add the cream, and bring to a boil.
Lower heat to medium.

Add cheese, nutmeg, and a dash of salt and boil, whisking frequently, until
reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste. If you don't notice a hint of
sweetness, add another dash of nutmeg.

Pour over cooked pasta, sprinkle with pepper and parsley, and serve hot.

h3. Notes

If you're making fettucine Alfredo, this is enough sauce for about 8 oz (½ a
pound) of pasta. 

The key to excellent Alfredo sauce is in the ingredients. Because this recipe
is so simple, you need to use the very best cream and freshly-grated,
high-quality parmesan cheese.

If you're worried about calories, you can use ½ and ½ or milk along with a T or
two of flour instead of the cream, but the taste and consistency of the sauce
will suffer for it.

Variation: add peas and/or mushrooms.
