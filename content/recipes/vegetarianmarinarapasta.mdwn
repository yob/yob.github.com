h3. Method

In short you pre-saute some mushrooms and put them aside, then in the same pot
heat some oil and nuttelex (vegetable oil based margarine) along with basil,
oregano and marjoram. Add tomatoes and a pinch of salt and let it simmer under
a medium to low heat with the lid on, stirring occasionally until the tomato is
almost broken down. Add in the mushrooms and perhaps some olives and let it
simmer until the tomato is completely broken down.
