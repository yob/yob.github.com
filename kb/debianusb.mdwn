## Building a Debian 4.0 (Etch) Installer USB Stick

Several times over the past 12 months I've encountered computers with CD-ROM drives that the Debian installer failed to recognise. Generally speaking it seems to occur on machines with Intel ICH7/ICH8 chipsets. The best way around this is to just avoid installing from CD altogether and install from a USB stick.

Some instructions are available in the etch [release notes](http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch04s04.html.en), however I found they missed a few details (like where to get the files!).

Grab a USB Stick of at least 256MB. I just picked a 1Gb one up for AU$14, so they're cheaper than a jug of beer these days.

Plug the stick in, and unmount it

Download the boot files for the USB stick (make sure you get the right architecture). I've used both i386 and amd64 successfully. A quick check of some other architectures shows that boot.img.gz isn't available for many of them.

    wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz
    wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-amd64/current/images/hd-media/boot.img.gz

Download a copy of the net install cd for the desired architecture. 

    wget http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/4.0_r0/i386/iso-cd/debian-40r0-i386-netinst.iso
    wget http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/4.0_r0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-40r0-amd64-netinst.iso

Copy the boot files to the USB stick

  zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sdb

Mount the USB stick

Copy the multi-arch ISO image onto the USB stick

Boot the target computer with the USB stick plugged in
