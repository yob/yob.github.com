## FreeSD Tips

### Debian comparison

* pkg_* seems to be a rough dpkg equivilant. A reasonably dumb package installer
* portupgrade seems to be a rought apt-get equivilant. Somewhat smarter than pkg_*, can satisfy dependencies automatically, etc

### Updating the ports tree

    cvsup -L 2 -h cvsup.jau.freebsd.org /usr/share/examples/cvsup/ports-supfile

### Upgrading a package

To the latest version from the ports tree
    
    portupgrade <package>

Upgrade all packages that depend on this one as well

    portupgrade -r <package>

Upgrade all packaged that this one depends on as well

    portupgrade -R <package>

Upgrade this package with a package where availablem otherwise compile from ports

    portupgrade -P <package>

Upgrade this package if it's already installed, or install it if it's not

    portupgrade -N <package>
