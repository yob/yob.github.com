## FreeSD Boot Settings

## /etc/rc.conf
Many boot time settings belong in here. Defaults are all specified in /etc/defaults/rc.conf. Look for settings in there, then override them in rc.conf.

## /boot/loader.conf

Select the modules to load at boot time here. Format is:

    modulename_load="YES"

ie.

    bridge_load="YES"
    dummynet_load="YES"
