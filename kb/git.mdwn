### git

Git is a distributed source control system. It can be a little tricky to get
the hang of initially - here's a few tasks I reguarly perform, but forget.

Clone an SVN repo:

    git-svn clone <svn repo path>

Pass git commits back upstream to SVN:

    git-svn dcommit

Merge a branch back into master (trunk) as a single commit. Run with the master branch checked out:

    git-merge --squash <branch name>

Make another commit, but make it an amendment of the previous one:

    git-commit --amend

Merge several previous commits into one. The selected commits will be displayed
in a text editior, and you can choose which ones to "squash". HEAD~10 means
show the last 10 commits.:

    git-rebase -i HEAD~10
