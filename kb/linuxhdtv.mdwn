## HDTV under linux

I've been working to setup a HDTV card on a headless linux box. This idea is to use it purely for timed recording, not live viewing, so I'm looking solely at commandline apps for use in scripts, not GUI apps or MythTV.

The card I'm using is a FusionHDTV DVB-T Lite, 2006 revision (PCI ID: 18ac:db1). Support for this revision was added to the kernel in mid 2006 - (link)[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=8c99024b88b5da3a73f0575dad98527c9a278d1b].

The Linux distribution is Debian testing (Lenny at the time of writing).

I haven't settled on a recording system I like yet, so this is just a braindump of various useful commands and links.

The first step is to get a channels.conf file for my city (Melbourne, Australia). For some unknown reason the debian dvb-utils has one located at /usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples/channels.conf-dvbt-australia.gz. Uncompress a copy of this to ~/.mplayer/channels.conf.

Dumping a stream with mplayer:

    mplayer -dumpfile ten.ts -dumpstream dvb://"Ten Digital"
