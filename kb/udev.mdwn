## UDEV

udev is a Linux daemon for responding to hardware events - a usb device being
plugged in, pcmcia card actions, etc.

This [blog post](http://www.cafuego.net/2007/11/11/time-machine-kinda) has some
interesting ideas on responding to a USB hard drive being inserted by running
an auto backup script. I found its instructions acurate, however the path to
the script to execute should be fully specified.  There's no environment set
when this script runs, so /usr/bin isn't on the path.

Also, to turn up the debug level so you can see what's going on in /var/log/syslog,
check the udev_log config option in /etc/udev/udev.conf
