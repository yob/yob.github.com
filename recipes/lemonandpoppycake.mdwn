* half cup water
* 1 cup sugar
* juice two lemons

h4. Cake

* For the cakes
* 2 cups SR flour
* 180 gm butter
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* just less than 1 cup orange juice or milk (I used orange juice)
* 1 pk/ 4 tb poppy seeds

h3. Method
# Cream butter and sugar; mix in egg; add other ingredients. Bake in patty cases of muffin pan, greased, at 200C for 20 minutes. (preheat oven for 10 minutes so the cakes do rise a little bit)
# Combine syrup ingrediants and boil for 1 minute.
# While still hot pour 1tbs over syrup over each cake.
# Store in a sealed container; best eaten within three days but the syrup keeps them reasonably fresh for a while.
