h3. Ingredients

* 2 pounds potatoes, peeled or scrubbed
* 4 hard-boiled eggs (optional), chopped
* ½-¾ Cup mayonnaise (regular or vegan)
* 1 Teaspoon mustard, prepared or dry
* ½ small red onion, chopped OR 1 scallion, sliced
* 1-2 carrots, peeled (optionally) and chopped
* 1 cucumber, seeded and chopped
* 1 stalk celery, chopped

h3. Method

Cut the potatoes into bite-size or slightly larger pieces.

Boil the potatoes for 15-20 minutes, just until the point where you insert a
fork and the potato falls off (overcooking can leave you with mashed potato
salad).

While the potatoes are cooking, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and onion.

Prepare the vegetables and stir them into the mayonnaise mixture.

Drain the potatoes, rinse with cold water, and fold them into the vegetables
along with the optional eggs. Serve warm.
