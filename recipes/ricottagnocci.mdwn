h3. Ingredients

* 1 Cup ricotta cheese
* 1 egg
* 1 Teaspoon nutmeg
* ½ Cup finely grated parmesan
* ½ to 1 Cup flour

h3. Method

Whisk the ricotta cheese with the egg until fluffy.

Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer.

Stir in the nutmeg and parmesan, turn out onto a floured board, then knead in
just enough flour to make the dough pliable and not sticky. Do not overmix.

Roll the dough into long strands about ¾-in in diameter. Cut into pieces about
1½-in long, then press down on both sides of each gnocchi with a fork, to form
shallow grooves.

Drop the gnocchi in the simmering water and cook just until they float, about 1
to 2 minutes.

Serve hot with sauce, or cover with cheese and broil for a few minutes.
