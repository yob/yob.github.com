h3. Ingredients

* 1 c plain yogurt
* 2 oz feta cheese, finely crumbled
* black pepper

h3. Method

Combine all of the ingredients and keep refrigerated until ready to use.

If it's too thick, whisk in a bit of milk.

h3. Notes

Feta cheese is usually quite salty, but if you're using one that isn't, you
might want to add a dash of salt to the dressing.

Yogurt feta dressing is great on Greek salad and roasted vegetables. Because
it's so simple, it's not as good on simple green salads; it needs something
"exciting" to accentuate.
